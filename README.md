# NGPs-for-delay-PDEs

Based on the work of Raissi et al. (2018) (Numerical Gaussian processes for time-dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations), we expand the method to delay PDEs. And we investigate many different delay PDEs in our work (Machine Learning for a Class of Partial Differential Equations with Multi-delays Based on Numerical Gaussian Processes).
